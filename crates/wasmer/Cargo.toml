# only done for imported functions.

# Enables async support for generated code, although when enabled this still
# needs to be configured through the macro invocation.
async = ['async-trait', 'wit-bindgen-wasmer-impl/async']

# Enables the ability to parse the old s-expression-based `*.wit` format.
